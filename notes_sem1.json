            "question": "What is C programming language?",
            "answer": "C is a high-level programming language that was developed in the 1970s at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie. It is widely used for developing system software and is considered a low-level language compared to other high-level programming languages like Python and Java. Despite its low-level nature, C is still a versatile language that can be used to develop a wide range of applications, from simple desktop applications to complex operating systems.\n\nThe syntax of C is based on the syntax of other programming languages like Pascal and ALGOL. C is a procedural language, meaning that it follows a step-by-step approach to solving problems. It supports the use of functions and pointers, which allow for better code organization and greater control over memory allocation.\n\nC is widely used in many different domains, including operating systems, embedded systems, game development, scientific computing, and many others. Its popularity is due to its efficiency, versatility, and compatibility with various platforms and hardware architectures. Many other programming languages, such as C++, Java, and Python, have borrowed concepts from C, making it a foundational language for many developers.",
